# CodeBank--JavaScript
Reusable JavaScript, a collection of various different functions, features and uses of simple JavaScript that I write for myself so I don't have to rewrite if something comes up. Will be updating as I go along, will refactor or design it to be as drag-and-drop as possible. Also serves as good practice for all these common JS use cases.
