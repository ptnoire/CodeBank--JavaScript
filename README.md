# CodeBank--JavaScript
Reusable JavaScript, a collection of various different functions, features and uses of simple JavaScript that I write for myself so I don't have to rewrite if something comes up. Will be updating as I go along, will refactor or design it to be as drag-and-drop as possible. Also serves as good practice for all these common JS use cases.

Update 4/7/23: I learned about snippets in VSCode.. but I can still host a lot of the snippets, I've been mostly using typeScript but to not forget the ROOTS I am going to upload more snippets just to complete this repo, never hurts to do.
